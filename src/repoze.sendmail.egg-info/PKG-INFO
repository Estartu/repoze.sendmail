        =============
        
        repoze.sendmail is a fork of zope.sendmail with dependency on zope security
        framework removed.  The idea being that in this case authorization should be
        handled by caller, not by this library, which simply provides a means to send
        email.  This fork is meant to be usable with repoze.bfg and other non-Zope3
        frameworks.
