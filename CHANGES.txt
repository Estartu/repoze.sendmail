2.0 (Unreleased)
----------------

Represents major refactoring with a number of backwards incompatible changes.
The focus of the changes is on simplifying and updating the internals,
removing usage of deprecated APIs, removing unused functionality and using the
`email` module from the standard library wherever possible. A few changes have
been made solely to reduce internal complexity.

- Public facing APIs no longer accept messages passed as strings.  Messages
  must be instances of email.message.Message.

- Deprecated APIs have been replaced with newer 'email' module throughout.

- Functions that return message ids no longer strip containing less than and
  greater than characters.

- Events were removed entirely.  There was nothing in the code actually
  performing a notify anyway.  Removes dependency on zope.event.

- Normalized directory structure.  (Got rid of 'src' directory.)

- Got rid of functions to send queued mail from a thread or a daemon process.
  These are more appropriately handled in the calling code.

- Removed vocabulary.  It was a fossil from its days as zope.sendmail and was
  not used by anything.

- Got rid of 'smtpMailer' zcml directive as that would tend to imply that you
  are putting deployment configuration in your zcml, which is a fundamentally
  broken pattern.

- Removed all interfaces that did not correspond to a rational plug point.
  This leaves only IMailDelivery and IMailer.

- Removed dependency on zope.i18nmessageid
