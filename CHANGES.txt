2.0 (Unreleased)
----------------

Represents major refactoring with a number of backwards incompatible changes.
The focus of the changes is on simplifying the internals and using Message
objects from the standard library to represent messages wherever possible,
to avoid unnecessary serialization and parsing.  The impetus for the changes
is support for RFCs that specify how unicode should be handled in header
values.  These standards are implemented in the standard library 'email'
module.  A few changes have been made solely to reduce internal complexity.

- Public facing APIs no longer accept messages passed as strings.  Messages
  must be instances of email.message.Message.

- Deprecated APIs have been replaced with newer 'email' module throughout.

- Functions that return message ids no longer strip containing less than and
  greater than characters.

- Events were removed entirely.  There was nothing in the code actually
  performing a notify anyway.  Removes dependency on zope.event.

- Normalized directory structure.  (Got rid of 'src' directory.)

- Got rid of functions to send queued mail from a thread or a daemon process.
  These are more appropriately handled in the calling code.
